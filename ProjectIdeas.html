                  Digital Webster-pak
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Project idea our team have decided to develop is essentially an application that would function somewhat like a digital Webster-pak, with some other functions built in. For those that are unaware, a Webster-pak is a pre-packaged schedule of medications that are arranged by a chemist.
                <br> <br>A patient’s weekly prescriptions are given to a chemist, who packages medications on a daily schedule. Each day is divided in a day/night section and the medication for that time is pushed out of a small blister seal in the package. The primary purpose for this is to aide in patient’s adhering to their medications schedule as many have quite a few different medications, it can become easy to lose track of what they have taken. This is the primary inspiration behind developing a digital Webster-pak. <br>
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Function
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Functionally, the way it would work would be that after having medications prescribed to the patient, the user would be able to input the schedule for these medications. This could go by monthly, weekly, daily, what time of day, and with or without food.
                <br><br>This could be particularly useful for particular times of day, as physical Webster-paks often only have a simple day or night schedule, leaving the particular time of day to be decided or remembered by the patient. After the user has input all the information and scheduling for their medication, the app would send a reminded or alarm each day for what medication needs to be taken. This can also be set-up to a particular time of day, and whether it should be taken with food or not.
                <br><br> If the user does not see the reminded or has not taken the medication, the app can intermittently send reminders until the user has marked off the medication as being taken. The benefits of this app would be that it could work in conjunction with a physical Webster-pak, increasing the user’s adherence to taking medications, reduce any confusion as to what needs to be taken, or whether or not a medication for the day has been taken, a on-going record, a record of their current prescription that could be used in Doctor appointments or with a pharmacist, and peace of mind for the user.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                  Alternatives and financial benefits
                  </h4>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there are apps in the medical field, a large portion of these seem to be oriented toward medical professionals such as Epocrates (Epocrates 2021) which operates as a medical reference for Doctors and medication tracker, but for a medical professional’s use. There are other apps and services that are oriented more toward the user, yet few offer the same idea. Some of these are reminder devices such as e-Pill TimeCap (e-Pill 2021) which is a device that records the last time a user opened the bottle and an alarm to remind them.
                  <br><br>A problem here is that this requires the purchase of a physical product, the cap may not fit the users bottles that were given to them by a pharmacist which means they would have to purchase additional bottles from e-Pill, and if they have multiple medications, they will need to purchase additional caps for each one. As the price of the TimeCap is $49.00 USD, or around $63.00, this alternative could become expensive very quickly. <br>
                <br>  A user taking only three medications would have an upfront cost of almost $200 AUD, and many patients have quite a few more medications than three. Another alternative is the MedMinder device (MedMinder 2021). Like the TimeCap, this is also a device that must be purchased. In addition to that, a monthly subscription is required for a pharmacist to fill the device regularly, adding an additional cost to the user. While functional, this service essentially functions quite similarly to a typical Webster-pak, with the added cost of having to buy the device and have a monthly subscription with the service.
                <br><br> A large problem with this is that many people who are on multiple medications are elderly who often have quite limited incomes, or people with disabilities who may also be limited on the amount of money they are able to spend. With the costs of simply having to buy medications regularly, additional costs for apps, devices, or services that aide in their medication may simply not be feasible for many users from a financial perspective. This is also another factor when considering the development of a digital Webster-pak. The app would require not additional purchases as far as devices or subscriptions go.
                <br><br>This helps to relieve the financial burden to any users of the app and poses no risk to them financially as well. If they find the app to be of little use to them, they simply do not have to use it anymore and it has come at no cost to them. There is also the benefit here financially. As physical Webster-paks must be organised with a user’s pharmacist, this comes at a cost in addition to simply the purchase of medication. Although this app could work in conjunction with physical Webster-paks, there is also the option of simply buying medications as they come standard in bottles or blister packs and using the digital Webster-pak app as the scheduling measure alone, eliminating the cost of buying physical Webster-paks. The app would simply be a one time download to a device such as a smart phone or tablet.

  <h4>
Design and development
  </h4>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of design for the end user, there will be a priority on simplicity and a very user-friendly interface. The idea behind this is driven primarily by accessibility. As Jakob Nielsen states (Nielsen 2006), ease of accessibility is the bigger hurdle for elderly users of technology to overcome. <br><br>
  Although this report is from 2006, this accessibility factor in the digital divide persists into 2021 due to many developers and companies focussing on younger generation users. Many users of the digital Webster-pak app would very likely be elderly users as these are often the demographics that are taking various medications, so it logically follows that a user interface and functionality that is very simple and easy to use should be a priority. <br><br>
  It should be designed in such a way that assumes the user is not very familiar with technology. If not, there could be a high rate of attrition from users of the app. As stated previously, users should have the option of inputting data such as medications, names, when they are to be taken and so on.
<br><br>
For the development of the app, the development platform appypie (appypie 2021) could be a good place to start. The platform offers a solution for a simple approach to building apps with no coding requirements. Depending on coding skills of the team, this could be a good option if coding skill requirements within the team are not high enough yet. There is also the idea of implementing a chatbot within the app. As an example for this, a chatbot could be used for users to ask questions such as if a medication may have the possibility of allergic reactions. <br><br>Appypie has systems built in where developers can implement AI and chatbot functionality which helps to meet the requirements for the apps development. Appypie is a starting point for the apps development, but should it not be able to meet all requirements, other alternatives could be looked at if any problems arise. The ideas and concepts would just need to be converted over to a different platform. As it stands, appypie seems to offer the tools needed to develop it as of now. By using a development platform such as appypie, it should help with keeping the skills requirements within feasible boundaries for all team members. An added benefit here is that the ease of use of this app would allow team members to alternate between tasks or help other team members if things fall behind schedule, making it a versatile development platform for the entire team.
<br><br>
Before developing the app, a design document should be created first and various tasks assigned to team members depending on their skills. This could be in the form of app functionality, designing the sections for user input in terms of code or how the data will be collected from the user, Chatbot functionality, formatting for different platforms e.g. Android or iOS, user interface or graphic design elements and so on. This document could also contain any ideas that could be implemented in future once the core concept of the app has been created. <br><br>Examples could be implementing food and diet recommendations based on a user’s requirements such as diabetics or those with high cholesterol, or an option to record exercise and activity data. These would likely come later once the primary focus of the app functioning as a digital Webster-pak is operating as intended. An early design mockup of the user interface can be seen below. As stated previously, simplicity and accessibility will be a primary focus, so the interface will be designed in the same fashion with very little clutter and easy to find functions.

<h5>
Overall intention
</h5>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary intention behind this app is to develop an app that is the digital equivalent of a Webster-pak while prioritising other concepts previously explained, including: <br><br>
  •  A very easy to use interface given the digital accessibility divide between demographics. It should be simple enough that those with very little experience in the use of technology should be able to figure it out.<br><br>
  •  Eliminating the financial cost of having to buy other devices. <br><br>
  •Although it would work in conjunction with a physical Webster-pak, it should be designed in such a way that a user could use the app as a Webster-pak organisational tool if they have not opted to have pharmacies pre-package physical Webster-paks. <br><br>
  •Make it compatible across common platforms, e.g. iOS and Android devices for accessibility. <br><br>
  •Make it function as a one-time input app (unless new prescriptions are prescribed to the user by a Dr.). This means the user should only have to input their prescriptions once and how they are scheduled. After this, the app should be able to notify them each time a medication is scheduled to be taken. The user should not have to check in constantly for the app to function as intended.
